* Getting Windows Ready
In order to get a graphical install of Linux working in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), we will need version 2.
WSL2 is only available in Windows 11 or Windows 10, Version 2004, Build 19041 or higher.
To find out which version of Windows your device is running, press the *Windows logo key + R*, type *winver* in the *Open* box, and then select *OK*.
If you do not meet the requirements, please update your machine before proceeding.
* Installing WSL2
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run (type all of the commands in this document manually, do not copy paste):
#+BEGIN_SRC
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
#+END_SRC
Now, restart your machine. Once again open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command
#+BEGIN_SRC
wsl --set-default-version 2
#+END_SRC
You might see this message after running that command: *WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component*.
If you do, visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel and install the latest WSL2 Linux kernel.
Once you have the kernel installed, run the above command again, and it should complete successfully without showing the message.
* Installing Ubuntu 20.04
Open the Microsoft Store and download Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Once it is downloaded, launch it like you would a normal application.
You will see something that looks like the following picture:
[[file:figs/ubuntuinstall.png]]
Create a username and password.
* Getting a Desktop Environment Working
We will need to transfer a file from our Windows file system to our Linux file system.
The Windows ~C:\~ drive is mounted by default at ~/mnt/c/~.
Go to that directory with the following command,
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval no-export
cd /mnt/c
#+END_SRC
Locate the *wsl-install.sh* script from the WebCourses files.
Copy it to our Linux home directory with
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval no-export
cp <path to wsl-install.sh> ~/
#+END_SRC

\noindent Run this script.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval no-export
cd ~
sudo bash wsl-install.sh
#+END_SRC

You will be prompted to choose a display manager, choose *gdm3*.
This script will take a while to run.
When the script finishes, close your WSL window.
Then, relaunch it.

* Starting the Desktop Environment
Now that the script has finished, start the service with
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
session start
#+END_SRC
Open the built-in Windows 10 remote desktop program.
Enter *localhost:3389* in the *Computer* box, then hit *Connect*.
Click *yes* if you are asked if you want to connect.
Log in with your Linux username and password.

* Tweaking the XFCE Desktop
The desktop environment (XFCE in our case) attempts to put the display to sleep after 10 min.
This causes our environment to become unresponsive.
To fix this, head into the lock screen settings in XFCE.
You can find this by clicking the magnifying glass icon in your dock and searching for "Light Locker".
Change your settings to reflect this picture, then apply ("Lock on suspend" will remain on, just make sure to turn off "Enable light-locker" and set "Blank screen after" and "Switch off display after" to "Never").

Congratulations! You should be able to follow the linux software install guide from now on.
